# Sentinel

**Sentinel** is a tower-defense action game developed for the "Linux Deutschland Game Jam." Every year on Halloween, your village is attacked by hordes of undead, and as a powerful mage stationed on a tower, it is up to you to fend off the attackers and protect the village.

Use powerful spells and strategically place archers along the enemies' path to stop the hordes. Defeated enemies drop gold, which you can use to buy upgrades and recruit new defenders. With each wave, the challenge increases, as enemies receive random bonuses.

## Gameplay

- **Magical Defense**: Cast powerful spells to repel the undead invaders.
- **Strategic Tower Defense**: Place archers along the enemy path to slow their advance.
- **Collect Gold**: Defeat enemies and gather gold to enhance your defenses and recruit new fighters.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: After each wave, enemies receive random bonuses, making the game progressively harder.
